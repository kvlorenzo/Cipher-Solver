# CipherSolver

CipherSolver is an educational web application designed to help users learn about basic ciphering techniques. The website offers an
easy-to-use graphical interface for anyone to interact with. As of right now, there are only two ciphering techniques (Caesar and
Vigenere), but more will be added soon once I take more cryptography classes!

Here is a quick glimpse of CipherSolver:

As you can see, there are are two text boxes, one for input and output. A user can enter in their own message and customize the ciphering settings, and the ciphered text will immediately appear in the output box on the right.

We also give you the option to work backwards and decipher the text.

And along with the encryption, we provide users with step-by-step instructions on how the message was ciphered.

And finally, users can look at the tutorials and further readings into the different ciphering techniques. The content has been provided
by the Wikipedia page of the corresponding cipher.

## How to use
Right now, the website is not available on the internet. However, you can still download the GitHub repository to try it out yourself.
  To Install:
  1. Clone the respository at https://github.com/kvlorenzo/Cipher-Solver.git in any terminal
  2. Change directory to be in the CipherSolver folder.
  3. Type the command "http-server ." to run the web application.
  4. Note the port number from the message. If yours is port 8080, then on a web browser, type "http://localhost:8080/src/html/index.html".
     If you are using a different port number, replace 8080 with the port number you are using.
  5. And voila! You're on the site.
